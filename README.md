# Project Summary

The goal of this project was to create a fully functioning e-commerce personal care website that allows customers to purchase products with Stripe. In addition the application provides the functionality that allows the Superuser/Admin to add, edit and delete products and add and edit blog posts. These actions can be done through Django admin site. 

Customers can also create accounts that allow them to store their delivery details and also allows them to see their order history.

Ellie Face is an online skincare and makeup e-commerce store. The store also has a blog page with skincare tips and advice.

# User Experience Design

## The Strategy Plane

Ellie Face is an e-commerce site, dominated in Euro and based in Ireland. It sells a curated range of skincare and makeup products.

## User Stories

As an e-commerce site owner...

* I want to offer a curated array of products that are displayed in a visually appealing manner and an easy to navigate shopping journey that ensures that customers have a good user experience. 
* I want to provide valuable information to users in relation to skincare so that they will return to the store to make repeat purchases.
* I want to be able to add, edit and adjust blog posts to both provide information and improve the site’s SEO.

## The Scope Plane 

In designing the page, I wanted it to be immediately clear what the purpose of the site is. The SHOP NOW button on the hero image achieves this, along with easy search in the header. 

### Features planned:

* Separate navigation bars for desktop and mobile devices. 
* Responsive Design - Site should be responsive on all devices. 
* On entering the homepage it will immediately clear what the purpose of the site is.
* Standard e-commerce feed of products with the option to sort products and filter them by category name. 
* Clear and obvious call to action buttons with a shop now button on the home page along with links to purchase the bestselling products.
* Blog page – useful and information skincare advice which will be added to on a regular basis.
* Contact form –so customers can contact the site owner by email directly in the site.
* Product ratings  - so customers can make informed purchase decisions.
* About page – providing users with an element of trust and transparency that there are people being the technology.

## The Structure Plane

When the user arrives on site, they will see the hero image and text which 
On entering the site, users are greeted with a colourful hero image of a lady with great skin. To the left of the image is a shop now button allowing customers to start shopping immediately if they wish.
Below this there are some images of the bestselling products, along with the prices for transparency.
Search and filter features on the top of every page allow customers to quickly and easily find the products they are looking for.

The products in the shop are divided into relevant categories, namely, face, eye and lips which makes it easier to find products. Customers are view the full details of any product by clicking on the product in the shop. Details include the name, description, image, price and rating.

Once customers add products to their cart, this cart will be visible at all times in the top right hand corner of the site. It will also display the current cart total in Euro.

Handy message notifications will also appear in the top right hand corner when a customer performs an action such as adding something to their cart, removing it etc.

Secure checkout has been implemented using Stripe and customers are redirected to a checkout form page when they are ready to pay.

The about page explains a little about the owners of the website with a paragraph to left of the image of the owners. The blog page contains a list of blogs with links on each to read more. The contact form contains a simple form allowing customers to email the site owners with any questions.

## The Skeleton Plane

### Wireframes

Balsamiq was used to create wireframes for the site. These are be found [here](wireframes).

The initial wireframes consisted of 10 pages and wireframes were created from desktop, mobile and tablet.
 

### Database Design

As Django works with SQL databases by default, I was using SQLite in development. Heroku, however, provides a PostgreSQL database for deployment

### User Model

The User model utilized for this project is the standard one provided by `django.contrib.auth.models`

### Profiles App

| Name | Database Key | Field Type | Type Validation |
| :-------------: |:----------------:| :--------------: | :---------: |
|User | user |	OneToOneField 'User'| on_delete=models.CASCADE
|Default Phone Number |	default_phone_number | CharField | max_length=20, null=True, blank=True
|Default Country | default_country | CountryField | blank_label='country', null=True, blank=True
|Default Postcode | default_postcode | CharField | max_length=20, null=True, blank=True
|Default Town or City | default_town_or_city | CharField | max_length=40, null=True, blank=True
|Default Street Address1 | default_street_address1 | CharField | max_length=80, null=True, blank=True
|Default Street Address2 | default_street_address2 | CharField | max_length=80, null=True, blank=True

### Products App

`Category` model

| Name | Database Key | Field Type | Type Validation |
| :-------------: |:----------------:| :--------------: | :---------: |
|Name | name | CharField | max_length=254
|Friendly Name | friendly_name | CharField | max_length=254, null=True, blank=True

`Product` model

| Name | Database Key | Validation | Field Type|
| :-------------: |:----------------:| :--------------: | :---------: |

|Description | content | blank=False | TextField
|Price | price | max_digits=6, decimal_places=2 | DecimalField
|Image| image| blank=False | ImageField
|Rating | rating | blank=True | DecimalField



### Order

| Name | Database Key | Validation | Field Type|
| :-------------: |:----------------:| :--------------: | :---------: |
|Order id | id | primary_key=True | AutoField
|User | user | User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="orders" | ForeignKey(User)
|Full name | full_name | max_length=50 | CharField
|Phone number | phone_number | max_length=20, blank=False | CharField

|Order | order | Order, related_name="orderline", null=False | ForeignKey
|Product | product | Product, null=False | ForeignKey
|Quantity | quantity | blank=False | IntegerField

### Security

Using config variables in heroku, all SECRET access keys are stored safely to prevent unwanted connections to the database.

Django allauth was used to set up user registration and built in decorators allowed restricted access to certain features on the website that are not intended for regular users.

# Deployment

## AWS S3
A new Amazon account was created and connected to amazon service AWS S3. This is a cloud based service where the project media and static files are stored. At first, we located S3 on amazon service amd then we created a bucket. While creating the bucket on S3, it was noted that public access must be all switched off to allow access for users.

Once we've created the bucket, we now can now click on it's properties and enable the Static Website Hosting option, so it can serve the purpose of hosting our static files, you will need to imput an index.html and error.html before saving. Then we go into the created bucket Permissions and click into CORS configuration, this part already have a prefilled default config, All that is needed is just to write the default code and save the config.

Then we go into the bucket policy to allows access to the contents across all web and inside this we will put in here some code including arn address displayed at the top of the heading. Then we go into amazon IAM to allow identity and access management of our stored files and folder. In the IAM service, we add a new group for our application and then we set the policies to ALL Then it generates a downlaodable zip file containing ID and KEY for us to use for the newly added group. This ID and KEY as to be stored in an environment variable.

This then allows us to into our terminal window and install some settings Boto3 Django Storages

The Django Storages is passed into the installed apps in settings and also a custom_storage file is created to store credentials in environment variable. And once everything looks fine we can run python3 manage.py collectstatic. This will collect all the static files in our app including any changes that is made. N.B this command has to be run in the development(local) environment each time a change is been made in the static files/folder And your folder and files should display in your AWS S3 BUCKETS
